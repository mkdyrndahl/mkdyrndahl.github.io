                            Throughout my studies I've learned how to code in C#, Java, HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, Node.js, React and JSX. 
                            Though I've recently started to specialize in web development, I've also attained A+ certification and graduated 
                            from Douglas College with a diploma in Computing and Information Systems. Check me out on <a href="https://github.com/mkdyrndahl?tab=repositories">Github</a> and
